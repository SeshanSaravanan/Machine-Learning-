# Scikit-Learn Project

This is a Scikit-Learn project that demonstrates the use of various machine learning algorithms for solving different problems. The project includes Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts that cover topics such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this project, you will need to have Python 3 and Scikit-Learn installed on your machine. You can install Scikit-Learn using pip by running the following command:
    `pip install scikit-learn`
    

You will also need to install any additional libraries or dependencies that are used in the project. These should be listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

To use this project, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the Jupyter Notebooks or run the Python scripts. The code is well-documented and should be easy to understand.

## Examples

This project includes several examples of using Scikit-Learn to solve different problems. These include:

- **Classification:** Building a classifier to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various medical measurements.
- **Regression:** Building a regression model to predict the price of a house based on its features.
- **Clustering:** Using clustering algorithms to group customers based on their purchasing behavior.
